## Cipher Descriptions
The ciphers that are both encrypted and decrypted in this collection of Python files include an additive cipher, multiplicative cipher, affine cipher, Viginere cipher, Hill cipher, and Rivest-Shamir-Alderman cipher.

### Monoalphabetic Ciphers
The additive, multiplicative, and affine ciphers are known as monoalphabetic ciphers, which means that each letter is replaced by another letter. For example, the letter A may be encrypted as the letter E, and every occurance of the letter A will be encrypted as the letter E. These are the weaker ciphers and can be broken through brute force. 

### Polyalphabetic Ciphers
The Viginere, Hill, and Rivest-Shamir-Alderman (RSA) cipher is polyalphabetic. This means that the letters aa may be encrypted as more than bb or dc, ect.
